Password Generator

- Write a program to create a random password :
- uses mixture of numbers, alphabets, and other symbols found on the computer keyboard to form a 12-character password which is unpredictable and cannot easily be memorized
- The components of the password are represented in the form of arrays. 
- Use the random method to select at least one character from each array of characters
- Since the 12-character password is required, so fill the rest of the length of the password left with randomly selected characters
- from an array formed from the combination of all the characters needed in the final password.
