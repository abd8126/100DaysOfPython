- You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
- Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
 - DO NOT write any print statements.
 - This is the scoring criteria:
 - Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
 - Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
 - Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
 - Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail
 - student_scores = 
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
